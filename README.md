# MCP for development on AWS

## Local testing

### Claude

Put this into your mcp config

```json
"aws_dev": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
    "run",
    "--project",
    "/Users/martinmacak/projects/mcp-aws-dev",
    "mcp-aws-dev"
    ]
}
```

just replace the path to your local mcp-aws-dev repo

### Additional environment variables

#### Artifacts dir

Use this directory to store artifacts generated by the server.

```
"MCP_ARTIFACT_DIR": "path",
```

#### MCP Database Schema Registry

Use this variable to specify the database schema registry. Inferred schemas are stored in the `database` directory.

```
"MCP_DATABASE_SCHEMA_REGISTRY": "database",
```

#### AWS Region

Use this variable to specify the AWS region.

```
"AWS_REGION": "eu-west-1",
```

#### AWS Knowledge Bases

```
"AWS_KNOWLEDGE_BASES": "profile/prof:kbid/name"
```

Use this variable to specify the AWS knowledge bases.

This variable is a comma-separated list of knowledge bases. Each knowledge base is specified as 
```
profile/${awsProfileName}:${knowledgeBaseId}/${knowledgeBaseName}
```

For example:
```bash
"AWS_KNOWLEDGE_BASES": "profile/my-org-tools/MyRole:R000000001/my-knowledge-base",
```

Knowledge bases are searched both by name and by id, so you can use either when asking the MCP server.
